Kakip supports a PCI-Express x1 interface which enables data rates of up to 1GB/s for high speed expansion.  
This enables it to take advantage of standard PC NVMe drives which offer exponentially higher random and sequential read/write speeds as well as improved endurance over SD cards or traditional eMMC storage.
